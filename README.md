Team-PP-CapstoneHow can complex datasets become more accessible to diverse stakeholders so they can more efficiently and effectively inform policy and programming?  Using the LSMS-ISA data, we aim to create a data product that can be utilized by policymakers such as governments and donors (who often lack strong quantitative skills), and by researchers (to leverage data, build on other models, etc.).  
Our goal is to: 
1.	Enhance the ability of donors, governments, NGOs, and researchers to leverage results from complex survey data and analysis to inform policy and programming.
2.	Allow researchers/experts to “open source” their models, so other researchers can learn from and build on their models that can be shared with stakeholders in real time.
